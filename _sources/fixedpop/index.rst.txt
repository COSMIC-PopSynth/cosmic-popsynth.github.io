Evolve a Milky Way population the `cosmic` way
##############################################
There are two executables that are installed when you pip install cosmic:

* runFixedPop

* gxRealization

These two executables generate the two components of a cosmic Milky Way population. The `fixed population` is generated first and is designed to fully describe the population of binaries that results from a user specified star formation history (SFH) and binary evolution model. The arguments necessary to run the runFixedPop executable can be found using the help command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ runFixedPop -h 

.. program-output:: runFixedPop -h 

There are currently two SFHs implemented in cosmic: constant over the course of a user specified amount of time or a burst spanning 1 Gyr at a user specified amount of time in the past. New implementations of SFHs will be added to the sample_SFH modules in the independent and multidim samplers.
